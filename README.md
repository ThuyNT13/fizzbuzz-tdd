This is a presentation at [Blue1647](www.blue1647.com) to explore best practices for designing code starting with Test-Driven Development and later on refactoring for DRYness. Having done TDD, refactoring should not break the code. 

Granted, FizzBuzz is a simple program to write, but breaking it down into its individual components is going to be a fun exercise in exploring design concepts.

It's also to test out ways to help others learn how to approach solving algorithms, to break down a complex problem into smaller parts. Make it less intimidating.
