This is a presentation at [Blue1647](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/240217744/) to explore best practices for designing code starting with Test-Driven Development and later on refactoring for DRYness. Having done TDD, refactoring should not break the code.

Granted, FizzBuzz is a simple program to write, but breaking it down into its individual components is going to be a fun exercise in exploring design concepts.

Also testing out ways to help coders learn how to approach solving algorithms by breaking down a complex problem into smaller, individual parts. Make it less intimidating.

The point of the exercise is not to write one-line, unreadable code. Readability is paramount and single-responsibility is golden.
